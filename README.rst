Cheat Sheets
============

This repository contains two things:

* a collection of cheat-sheets, notes and documents I write primarily for my
  own use.
* Documents I that contain answers (and more) to questions I recieved from
  friends. I decided to create a github project for two reasons:

    #. readthedocs
    #. so it's easier for people to follow changes
